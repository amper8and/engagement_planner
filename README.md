## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Hono framework (lightweight, fast edge runtime)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (distributed SQLite)
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages (edge network)
- **Font**: Google Fonts - Noto Sans

## Data Architecture

### Database Schema

**Plans Table**:
- `id` (TEXT, PRIMARY KEY): Unique plan identifier
- `title` (TEXT): Plan title
- `start_date` (TEXT): Plan start date (ISO format)
- `end_date` (TEXT): Plan end date (ISO format)
- `created_at` (DATETIME): Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` (DATETIME): Last update timestamp

**Steps Table**:
- `id` (TEXT, PRIMARY KEY): Unique step identifier
- `plan_id` (TEXT, FOREIGN KEY): Reference to parent plan
- `type` (TEXT): Step type - 'initial', 'intermediate', or 'end'
- `action_title` (TEXT): Short title of the action
- `action_description` (TEXT): Detailed description
- `date` (TEXT): Scheduled date for the step
- `progress` (INTEGER): Progress percentage (0-100)
- `success_probability` (INTEGER): Success likelihood (0-100)
- `status` (TEXT): 'Planned' or 'Concluded'
- `review` (TEXT): Post-completion review notes
- `step_order` (INTEGER): Order within the plan
- `created_at` (DATETIME): Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` (DATETIME): Last update timestamp

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/plans` - Fetch all plans with their steps
- `GET /api/plans/:id` - Fetch a single plan with steps
- `POST /api/plans` - Create a new plan
- `PUT /api/plans/:id` - Update an existing plan
- `DELETE /api/plans/:id` - Delete a plan (cascades to steps)

## User Guide

### Creating a New Plan

1. Click "New" button in the sidebar
2. Enter plan title, start date, and end date
3. The system creates a plan with Initial and End steps automatically

### Managing Steps

**Adding Steps**:
- Click the "+" button between existing steps to insert a new step
- Click "Add step" button to add a step before the End step

**Editing Steps**:
- Click on any field to edit (title, description, date, status)
- Adjust progress and success probability using sliders or number inputs
- Initial step progress is fixed at 0%, End step at 100%

**Reordering Steps**:
- Use ← → arrows on intermediate steps to move them
- Steps flow left to right chronologically

**Removing Steps**:
- Click "Remove" button on any intermediate step
- Initial and End steps cannot be removed

### Understanding Metrics

**Plan Progress**: Shows the highest progress percentage among concluded steps

**Success Probability**: Calculated heuristically based on:
- Number of remaining planned steps (decreases probability)
- End step success probability (upper limit)
- Displayed as minimum of these factors

**Validation Checks**: The system automatically flags:
- Start date after end date
- Steps scheduled outside plan dates
- Non-monotonic progress (decreasing left to right)
- Incorrect progress on Initial (should be 0%) or End steps (should be 100%)

### Concluding an Engagement

1. Complete all intermediate steps and mark as "Concluded"
2. Add review notes for each concluded step
3. Click "Conclude engagement" button
4. This marks the End step as Concluded

## Recent Updates

### February 23, 2026 - Progression Percentage in Sidebar
- **Added**: Progression percentage display in sidebar plan mini-cards
- **Feature**: Each plan card now shows completion percentage next to the title
- **Calculation**: Uses maximum progress of all concluded steps (same as main view)
- **Benefit**: At-a-glance view of engagement completion status without opening each plan
- **Example**: "Example Engagement Plan 45%"

### February 23, 2026 - Active Card Always Visible (v6 - FINAL CORRECT FIX)
- **Fixed**: Active card now stays consistently centered and visible during all typing
- **Issue**: When typing in cards like "Follow up", the card would be positioned off-screen so users couldn't see what they were typing
- **Root Cause**: Previous approach tried to PRESERVE scroll position, which meant cards that started off-screen stayed off-screen during typing
- **The Misunderstanding**: "No recentering" was interpreted as "preserve scroll position" but actually means "keep active card centered and visible"
- **Correct Solution**: After cursor restoration, **ALWAYS center the active card**
  - Removed: savedScrollLeft save/restore logic
  - Removed: Double enforcement attempts
  - Added: `stepCard.scrollIntoView()` after cursor restoration
  - Uses `behavior: 'auto'` for instant positioning (no animation)
  - Uses `inline: 'center'` to keep card in viewport center
- **Result - CONSISTENT BEHAVIOR**:
  - ✅ Click any card → centers immediately
  - ✅ Type in any field → card stays centered and visible
  - ✅ Active card is ALWAYS on screen during typing
  - ✅ User can always see what they're typing
  - ✅ Consistent positioning - same center point every time
  - ✅ No cards positioned off-screen during interaction

### February 23, 2026 - CRITICAL Scroll Position Lock (v3)
- **Fixed**: FORCIBLY lock scroll position during cursor restoration to prevent ANY movement
- **Solution**: Aggressive scroll position preservation - save scrollLeft before, force restore after
- **Note**: This version only worked for title field, extended in v4 above

**Testing Instructions:**
1. Open the app and select a plan with multiple steps (e.g., "Example Engagement Plan")
2. **Test consistent centering**:
   - Click on the first step card (e.g., "Kickoff call") → should center
   - Type something → card stays centered and visible
   - Click on a different card (e.g., "Follow up meeting") → should center
   - Type "123" → card stays centered and visible, you can see "123"
3. **Test all three text fields** (all should keep card centered):
   - Type in Action Title → card stays centered
   - Type in Action Description → card stays centered
   - Change status to "Concluded", type in Review → card stays centered
4. **Key validation**: At NO point should an active card be off-screen where you can't see what you're typing

### February 23, 2026 - Previous Scroll Fix Attempts (v1-v2)
- v2: Attempted to track last scrolled card ID to prevent re-scrolling same card
- v1: Attempted to use click-based scroll with mousedown listener
- Both approaches failed because they didn't address the underlying cursor restoration scroll issue
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `data-step-card` attribute to step card containers
  - Created dedicated `scrollStepCardIntoView()` function
  - Added mousedown event listener that detects clicks and scrolls parent card
  - Removed all focus event scroll logic
  - Removed `isRestoringFocus` flag (no longer needed)
  - Cursor restoration uses `preventScroll: true`
- **Result**:
  - ✅ Click anywhere on step card → card centers in viewport
  - ✅ Click input field → parent card centers in viewport
  - ✅ Type in any field → ZERO scroll, viewport completely stable
  - ✅ Simple, maintainable code
  - ✅ Works for all input types

### February 23, 2026 - Previous Scroll Fix Attempts (Superseded)
- Attempted to use `isRestoringFocus` flag and `preventScroll: true`
- These approaches were overly complex and fought with browser behavior
- Replaced with clean click-based solution above

### February 23, 2026 - UI/UX Polish Release
- **Fixed**: Step cards now top-aligned for professional appearance (was center-aligned)
- **Fixed**: Inputs off-screen auto-scroll into view on initial focus
- **Implementation**: Changed flex alignment from `items-center` to `items-start`
- **Implementation**: Added focus event listener with scrollIntoView
- **Result**: Cleaner card layout, smart initial scroll

### February 23, 2026 - UX Improvement Release
- **Fixed**: Cursor jumping/loss of focus when typing in plan title and input fields
- **Root Cause**: Full DOM re-render on every keystroke destroyed and recreated all input elements
- **Solution**: Preserve active element focus and cursor position before render, restore after DOM updates
- **Result**: Smooth, uninterrupted typing experience in all input fields

### February 23, 2026 - Bug Fix Release
- **Fixed**: Multiple plans being created when clicking "New" button once
- **Root Cause**: Event listeners were being attached on every render, causing duplicates
- **Solution**: Implemented guard flag and moved event listener attachment to startup only
- **Added**: Comprehensive regression prevention strategy document (see `REGRESSION_PREVENTION.md`)

## Quality Assurance

This project includes a comprehensive regression prevention strategy. Before making any changes:
1. **Read** `REGRESSION_PREVENTION.md` for the complete checklist
2. **Test** all critical paths before deployment
3. **Verify** the fix locally before pushing to production

Key principles:
- Event listeners must only be attached once at startup
- Use event delegation pattern for dynamic content
- Test ALL modules after ANY change
- Complete the pre-deployment checklist

## Future Enhancements
